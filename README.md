# Villagelife

Welcome! This mod introduces AI NPCs into your Minecraft world, adding a dynamic and autonomous village-building experience.

## Features

- **Autonomous NPCs**: These AI villagers independently build and develop their own villages.
- **Dynamic Villages**: Watch as the NPCs create a living, evolving community.
- **Quests and Interaction**: Engage with the villagers, assist them in quests, and form friendships (work in progress!).
- **Independent Progression**: Villagers work autonomously, creating a unique and evolving world.
